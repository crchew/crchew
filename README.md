### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an aspiring web developer. Used to work in digital marketing and media monitoring but discovered my interest in coding later.

I'm currently enrolled in the Sigma School Complete Software Development Programme, where we learn four modules: Coding Fundamentals, Front End, Back End, and Full Stack.

Languages I'm using / learning: 

Front End: HTML, CSS, JS, Bootstrap
Back End: PHP
DB: MySQL
